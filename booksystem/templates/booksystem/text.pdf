Generally, you’ll store templates in files on your filesystem rather than using the
low-level Template API yourself. Save templates in a directory specified as a template directory.
Django searches for template directories in a number of places, depending on your template 
loading settings (see “Loader types” below), but the most basic way of specifying template 
directories is by using the DIRS option.
